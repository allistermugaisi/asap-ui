							<span>Corporate Due Diligence and Investigation Services</span>
						</div>
						<div class="description-3">
							<p>
								Our investigation services focus mainly on corporate
								investigations and individual background checks. As part of our
								company data-acquisition processes, we have covert undertakings
								as a way of obtaining confidential company information, which is
								neither prejudicial to the said entities. We devise and conduct
								domestic and international due diligence investigations of
								clientsâ€™ potential company portfolios, joint venture partners,
								vendors, suppliers, sub-contractors, investors and prospective
								candidates for executive hire.
							</p>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>
								Our investigative professionals will obtain top-quality,
								up-to-date business intelligence needed for you to confidently
								make an informed business decision. We begin our engagement with
								you by having discussions on your requirements with you and
								develop a custom-designed due diligence investigation programme
								that is well adapted to your business needs and programmatic
								structures. Our strong network of offices and contacts in the
								region, combined with our in-depth knowledge and understanding
								of local business practices and corporate culture, ensures we
								can complete our due diligence investigations with the utmost
								professionalism, diplomacy, creativity and sensitivity.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="more-desc">
							<h3>Investigative Due Diligence</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="description-3">
							<p>
								The Investigative Due Diligence report provides customized
								investigation into the conduct of a company or individual.
								Leveraging our proprietary, ethical and standard investigation
								procedures, we are able to locate the subject and verify contact
								and basic information. Using this as a launch point, we can
								tailor each investigation appropriately to meet specific client
								requirements.
							</p>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>
								Our preliminary due diligence research focuses on the collection
								of information through publicly available records through
								national and international databases. We review and analyze
								areas including a subjectâ€™s address history and property
								records, civil, criminal, bankruptcy and tax-related litigations
								against them in the past if any, and any adversarial
								environments in any quasi-judicial processes in which the
								individual may have been adversely mentioned, or appears as an
								inculpated party.
							</p>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>
								Of concern to us also, is the place at which an investigative
								subject may have (been) domiciled, worked and/or appears as a
								mentioned party in whichever capacity or circumstance. Our
								partner lawyers and in-house investigators are experts in
								complex fact-finding investigations and have honed their
								information-collection and analytical skills in a variety of
								legal, criminal, covert, financial and governance matters.
							</p>

							<h3>Supply Chain Risk Management</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="description-3">
							<p>
								Vendor or supplier-profiling within a supply-chain is critical
								to averting supply chain risks. A majority of companies are
								oblivious to whether procural improprieties are rife in their
								supply chain, because they may not regard supply chain due
								diligence as of prime importance. Due diligence in supply chains
								assumes various front, thus; general reputation risk management
								and customer/supplier/distributor due diligence. We have
								compartmentalized the supply chain due-diligence into the
								following areas:
							</p>
							<br />
							<div class="supply">
								<ul>
									<li>Know your customer</li>
									<li>Know your supplier</li>
									<li>Know your Distributor/Agent</li>
									<li>Know your Vendor</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p>
								We can get all your suppliers, customer, distributor, and
								vendor-profiling by consolidating their data into a
								comprehensive report.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="product-tab" id="p4" style="display: none">
						<div class="right-title">
							<span>Screening and Background checks</span>
						</div>
						<div class="description-3">
							<p>
								We undertake checks on individuals that are of interest to your
								company or engagement you prospect to have with them. The
								background research aims to obtain all available information
								including an individualâ€™s personal information, professional
								background, and business interests, both past and present,
								directorship and shareholding interests and if available,
								adversarial or prosecutorial information on any past criminal
								and civil misconduct.
							</p>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>
								The Background Check encompasses a number of investigations to
								retrieve information concerning an individualâ€™s professional
								history. The Background Screening offers a number of checks
								including; Employment Screening where we seek to confirm the
								employment history of a given individual, CV Verification which
								aims to confirm the authenticity of professional information
								provided by the individual in trying to secure employment; and
								Professional Certificates Verification which aims to validate
								information concerning professional accreditations.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="more-desc">
							<h3>Know your employee(KYE)</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="description-3">
							<p>
								You need to employ the right people for the right roles, quickly
								and with confidence. KnowYourEmployee (KYE) gives you the
								intelligence you need to confirm if your new recruits are who
								they claim to be, and that you are meeting all your statutory
								and regulatory obligations.
							</p>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>
								We undertake screening services that are flexible to meet strict
								client requirements. Besides, we also authenticate the integrity
								and credentials of potential employees and tailor solutions to
								your particular needs which help mitigate the risk of
								operational losses that can result from uninformed recruiting.
								Effective screening minimizes potential threats to your company
								as well as the cost of employing unsuitable candidates on the
								basis of falsified CVs. It also reduces the risk of fraud and
								dishonesty within your organization.
							</p>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>The main components of our checks are:</p>
							<br />
							<div class="supply">
								<ul>
									<li>Subject Identity i.e. birth date, place of birth etc.</li>
									<li>Career history verification.</li>

								</ul>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p>
								We collate information on job performance, productivity,
								attitude, skills and attendance record. This report will be
								limited by the information forthcoming from the referee, but our
								researchers are well-trained and experienced interviewers who
								will elicit as much information as possible and as necessary.

								the applicantâ€™s referees in order to build up a comprehensive
								image of the applicantâ€™s character. Additionally, we will
								question supplied referees when there is a gap in his/her career
								history or when there was self-employment at any time in his
								career history.
